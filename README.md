# CPE 613 Semester Project
## Current Status
### FFT - BROKEN
- Currently, implementation of Python Bindings are being created to make generating and plotting data easier
- CUDA reference implementation and CPU reference implementation are working
- CUDA implementation works as of the last test made, but most likely won't compile due to file changes
- These issues will be sorted out when I decide how I want the final test harness to look, which I am indecisive of at the moment
